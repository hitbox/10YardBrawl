Ball carrier doesn't animate top half
Both arms up for half time
Celebrate on touchdown and interception
Can't pause during defense button prompt

That weird up-scrummage sprite has solid pixels for a reason--so the
down-scrummage sprite can sit right on top.

    What to do about ref-first-down-left?
        The slicer/framer thinks it should be 16x32 and sliced.
